# Problem Statement

Develop a simple API to categorize images, distinguishing between a car or a human. The requirements for this task are as follows:

## Tasks

1. **API Development with Flask:**
   - Utilize Flask to create the API that accepts an image as input.
   - The API should be capable of receiving image data through a specified endpoint.

2. **Image Classification with YOLO:**
   - Employ any version of YOLO (You Only Look Once) for image classification.
   - Implement the model to accurately determine whether the input image contains a car or a human.

3. **Docker Integration:**
   - Implement Docker for the final output to ensure easy deployment and scalability.

4. **Payload for Testing:**
   - Share the payload details for testing using Postman.
   - Optionally, provide a Postman collection or API hit details to facilitate testing and validation.

## Approach:

In this approach, the YOLOv8 model was employed as the foundation for an image classification system. To enhance the model's performance and adapt it to specific requirements, a process known as fine-tuning was carried out. Fine-tuning involves training the model for a certain number of additional epochs, in this case, 5 epochs, to better align it with the nuances of the target dataset or task.

Furthermore, to make the capabilities of the model accessible through web-based interactions, a [Flask] API (Application Programming Interface) was employed. Flask is a web framework for Python that facilitates the creation of web applications, including APIs. Within this framework, a specific API endpoint named "upload" was established. This endpoint is designed to handle incoming POST requests, which typically involve sending data to the server. In this context, it implies that the system can receive input data for processing, likely images or related information relevant to the YOLOv8 model.

The results or outputs of the model's predictions are then formatted and presented in the [JSON] (JavaScript Object Notation) format. JSON is a lightweight data interchange format commonly used for transmitting data between a server and a web application, providing a structured and easy-to-read representation of information.

To enable communication between the client and server, a specific port, in this case, 5000, was selected for the Flask API. Ports are numerical designations used to distinguish different communication channels on a computer network. By specifying the port, the API becomes accessible at a defined network address, allowing external systems to interact with the YOLOv8 model through the designated "upload" endpoint. This facilitates seamless integration and utilization of the object detection capabilities in a web-based context.
